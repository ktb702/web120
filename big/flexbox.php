        <h2>Flexbox</h2>
        <p>Flexible box layout (flexbox) is a layout model that allows for powerful alignment and space distribution. It is best used for one dimension layouts (either rows or columns), and it allows for responsive elements to automatically be rearranged depending on the screen size. Although similar, flexbox serves a different purpose to grid. Grid is better suited for two dimension layouts, as it works with both rows and columns. Grid could be used for overall layout, while flexbox can be used for aligning content. They can also be used in tandem. Below is a quick comparison guide¹.</p>

        <p>Flexbox can be broken down into 3 main components: orientation, alignment, and flexibility. Orientation refers to the way the elements are oriented to the page in terms of direction, order and wrap. It determines the direction of the main axis and cross axis. Alignment refers to how the elements are lined up along the main axis and the cross axis(at the beginning, middle, end, or evenly spaced between/along). The flexibility component allows the child elements to grow and shrink. Below is a table showing the flexbox properties².</p>

        <p>There are several instances where flexbox is commonly used. One of those is for navigation. It allows for the navigation buttons to be easily aligned and spaced in many different ways. It also allows for easy vertical centering of an element. One very helpful way to use flexbox is to keep the footer at the bottom of your page. It will allow the content within your page to grow, while at the same time always keeping the footer nicely at the bottom. Flexbox can be utilized with media objects also. One example is having a media object with text aligned next to it that may need to shrink or grow. Finally, flexbox is useful when styling form controls.</p>
