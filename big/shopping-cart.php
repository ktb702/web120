        <h2>Shopping Cart</h2>
        <p>According to Wikipedia, “Website monetization is the process of converting existing traffic being sent to a particular website into revenue”¹. There are many ways to turn your website into profit. Some of the most popular are advertising and pay per click, affiliate marketing/links, donation based, memberships, or by selling your own products/services. Let’s focus on the last one for a moment. If you are considering selling your own products or services, you are going to need a shopping cart solution for your website. </p>

        <p>With the dozens of options available for shopping cart solutions, it’s easy to get overwhelmed with choices. It is an important choice after all, your customers will not likely return to your site if the checkout experience is not user friendly. According to Angelica Wolf of IRMG, “A confusing checkout process leads to as much as 11% of abandoned carts. That, combined with not having enough payment options, accounts for almost 20% of all abandoned carts”². Make it short, simple, and it helps to include a progress bar as a visual element if the process is longer than one page. Many consumers will also abandon their carts if they aren’t given the option to checkout as a guest, as the time it takes to set up the account may be perceived as not worth the hassle. </p>
        
        <p>The need to offer more payment options than just credit or debit cards continues to rise, with many people preferring to use PayPal, Google Pay, or Apple Pay. Also, having a good shopping cart on your website instills trust in your user and lets them know that they are dealing with a professional online seller. Customers want to see online trust badges during the payment process, such as the Norton Secured logo. According to Dan Shewan of WordStream, “more than 75% of consumers had chosen against making a purchase because they didn’t recognize the trust logos”³.</p>

        <p>A few other things to consider when designing your shopping cart are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Include thumbnail pictures of the products in the customers cart.</li>
            <li>Make it obvious that they have items in their cart ready for checkout.</li>
            <li>Make it obvious that they have items in their cart ready for checkout.
                Be upfront about any additional costs (especially shipping costs!), and shipping times.</li>
            <li>Assure customers that they will be satisfied with their purchase by offering money back guarantees.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In conclusion, the easiest way to turn the traffic to your website into profit conversions is to provide a seamless checkout experience. </p>
